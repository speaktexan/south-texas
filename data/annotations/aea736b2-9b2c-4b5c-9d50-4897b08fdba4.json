As part of this project, a linguistic researcher is asking that we interview participants and reading\na brief passage which should only take a couple of minutes. It's a short made up story about life in\nTexas that was created in the 1980s. And since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few\n100,000 Texans reading it. They use these recordings as samples of people standard way of speaking\nas they tried to track how speech in Texas varies and changes over time. Will you be willing to read a\nbrief passage aloud?"

In the winter we build a fire on the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and\npecans. I guess I was a life wire. a long time I go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook\nmy favorite foods. fried okra helping John, that's ri-- that's rice and Black Eyed Peas, and pecan pie.\nWe had lots of good times but going home is not the same now, after daddy died, Mama sold the farm\nand moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and\nkids don't understand. When I gripe about city life, and talk about moving to the country. My eldest child\nsays, Daddy, that's crazy. I just die if I had to live on a farm. I'd almost cry the first time she said that. I\nknow Texas is changing. But I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in\na city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land. Have a sense of place and take pride in being\nTexan.
