Before we conclude our interview. One of the over arching\nresearch questions through the home to Texas program is about linguistic changes in Texas. As part of\nthis project, a linguistic researcher is asking that interview participants read a brief passage, which\nshould only take about a couple of minutes. It is a short made up story about life in Texas that was\ncreated in the 1980s. And since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few 100 Texans reading it.\nThey use these recordings as samples of people standard way of speaking as they try to track how\nspeech in Texas varies and changes over time. Would you be willing to read a brief passage out loud?"

Before we conclude our interview. One of the over arching\nresearch questions through the home to Texas program is about linguistic changes in Texas. As part of\nthis project, a linguistic researcher is asking that interview participants read a brief passage, which\nshould only take about a couple of minutes. It is a short made up story about life in Texas that was\ncreated in the 1980s. And since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few 100 Texans reading it.\nThey use these recordings as samples of people standard way of speaking as they try to track how\nspeech in Texas varies and changes over time. Would you be willing to read a brief passage out loud?"
