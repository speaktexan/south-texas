So but, but I think that\nthere's, there's a lot of, there's parks here, and there's um, places for students to go for kids to go and\nenjoy. And then you know, even something like a farmers market, you know, things like that. So I think\nthat all those are kind of the good things in here in the community and you just but you know, you just have to, you have to take advantage of it. I mean, I mean, you have to make the step to be part of all\nthat and, and then there's just a lot of opportunities to be involved in something that you might be\npassionate about and and it's it's your it's your role to seek that out and find it in. And, you know, there's\nalso like, opportunities for like young people to learn about to get involved in the in the city or to get\ninvolved in, learn about what they can do to make it better. You know? I think that's it."

And we were able to do things differently,\nthat we can't do now. I mean, even like the theater across the street, the [LOCAL COMMUNITY\nTHEATHER], yes, that's a beautiful old theater that that was the only theater in town, and everybody\ncame to the theater and to see the movies there. And so we can't, I mean, that's, we don't have that\nanymore. Although I'm think they're going to do something. But I think that, that, maybe that sense of\ncommunity, while it may be gone, or maybe in another way, because of, you know, everything, you\nknow, everything changes and towns grow. But, you know, it'd be nice to keep that, but I think there's\nother things here that like the team spirit and things like that, that that maybe have replaced that part of\nit, not maybe replaced it, but that's still an important part. And it really was way back when so that's kind\nof stated, that's the idea of, of people always helping people or, or even, not even only that, but like,\nyou know, if someone believes in something like, I mean, I'll give you an example, the Amelia Earhart\nstatue, the woman who really made that happen. That was, I mean, she's old, she's much older than\nme much, much older than me. But, I mean, she believed in that and, and now that she's done that,\nthat certain person has done other projects in this city. So I mean, so I mean, that I don't know how I\ngot on that subject. But, but, um, but the idea that if you're passionate about something and you care\nabout your communities, then you there are opportunities to do that. And even this person wasn't even\nfrom this community. She moved her because her as her husband was from here, so um, so yeah."

Some backstory on that one of the\noverarching research questions about the home to Texas program is about linguistic changes in Texas.\nAnd as part of this project, a linguistic researcher is asking that interview participants read this brief\npassage, which only take a couple of minutes about one to two. I think it's a short made up story about\nlife in Texas. That was created in the 1980s. And since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few\n100 texts insane it and they use these recordings as samples of people standard way of speaking, as\nthey try to track speech changes throughout.

I was born in Titus County. And when I\nwas five, we moved to a farm near White House, which is southeast of Tyler. I liked growing up in the\ncountry. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees, or hike down to the creek to fish or\nswim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we'd swing out wide over the swimming\nhole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring, I'd fly Clyde\nkites, and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd\nhave fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter. We build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn\nand roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a Livewire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a\nFirestone Tire store. I didn't like save life. And for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama\nwould always cook my favorite foods fried Oka, Hot fried okra, okra hopping John. That's rice and black\neyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy\ndied, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in\nthe city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to\nthe country. My oldest child says, Daddy, that's crazy. I just die if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried\nthe first time she said that. I know Texas is changing. But I try to make sure we don't lose touch with\nour roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land. Have a sense\nof place and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress just too\nhigh"
