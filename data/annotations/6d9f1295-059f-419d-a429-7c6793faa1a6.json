And even when they were to go to schools, they can not just learn one language, they can learn two languages, or even three languages in our public schools here in the Rio Grande Valley. So we have really expanded ourselves into you know, bringing in others to live in this area, not thinking oh my god, we're just gonna go live in Mexico. Well, you're not anymore, you're living in a wonderful area. It I still say is safe. It's got a lot of education.

We all pretty much have the same ideas to go forward. Now we're going to do is let's do it. I mean, it'd be great, you know, that would bring more people to the city of [COMMUNITY NAME] that would really help us for people to understand what we who we are down here. He used to laugh right after when I was in college. I would ask that my family my friends when I lived in [OTHER TEXAS CITY] and live in [OTHER TEXAS CITY], and I said, \"Hey, I'm gonna go home for the weekend. I'm gonna drive down. Does anybody want to go?\" \"Me? Really? Can we really go? I mean, and where are we going to stay?\" I said like \"My house?\" [LAUGHS] You know? And \"Are there donkeys?\" I said, \"There are donkeys, there's horses, there's pigs, there's everything.\" You know, they used to be like, \"God I really want to go,\" you know, and when they'd come to [COMMUNITY NAME], because they were from Dallas, or San Antonio or Austin, and never probably come south, not knowing where we lived, or what we did. And then they're like, \"Oh, my God, this is amazing.\" This is yeah, we have a real home, you know, home just like y'all that we have. A lot of them weren't understanding where we were who we were at, you know, in the Rio Grande Valley, because we were so close to Mexico. I mean, they didn't know \"Do we live in Mexico?\" Where do we, you know, and I was always like, \"Okay, you can't really be honestly telling asking these questions,\" but they did. And they, I mean, you know, and a lot of them \"God I wanna come back.\" And not only because we were in [COMMUNITY NAME] for a couple of days in shopping and everything, but we could actually cross the border with no problem and go shopping in Mexico, that I think to them was the greatest event that they had, while they were here. So I remember those days a lot, a lot. "

And always like when when it comes to like the mayors or like the, you know, commissioners or, you know, those who are involved in politics or whatever, they make a difference, you know, like the county, county commissioners, everybody really likes to come back and make make sure that the South Texas is seen known and understood. And some of them just like they, it doesn't matter to them, you know, so there's one small area that that is that way, which is sad, but the rest everybody else I think in in the Rio Grande Valley, like I said, nowadays, you just cross the street and you go from [COMMUNITY NAME] to [NEARBY CITY] or you go from [NEARBY CITY] to [COMMUNITY NAME]. You know, because we're all we've really grown I mean, we have over a million people just living in this area alone.

There's so many different things that happened to these children, that when we get them it's like oh my god, you know, if I could I'd take them all home, because they just deserve such more such a better life. You know, they deserved a hug, they deserve a bath. They deserve lunch, they deserve schooling. They deserve so much to be able to thrive when they're older, not have to hide behind something because they're scared not have to be sad all the time because they've been beaten or they haven't been fed or you know the kids at school make fun of them because they don't have the same outfits that the other kids have. Because sometimes they have to go to school in the same outfit because no one bathes them or changes them.\" So you know, those kids have it harder, much harder. And we need to figure out how we can continue to make a difference with these children so that they're not, they're like, \"Oh, there they come no, oh, hey, she's coming over here, come over.\" So you know, we have to, and little by little, I think we know, it's getting better, but it'll never go away. But we just have to make sure that we are getting there faster to take care of them. So they can have a permanent, happy home. "

I was to take him back. I was in shock. But I did it. And little by little I was calling people to come by and say what can we help you?

Do you know how to fix the state? Do you know how to do this?\" And so And even today, I say oh, by the way, \"Can you water my plants? Can you go fix the back?\" The door fell down, can you you know, so I am always constantly making sure that [WORKPLACE] is thriving. And then [WORKPLACE] is everybody knows who [WORKPLACE] is today. Everybody knows what we do here. Because we've put ourselves out there and asked for help ask for donations asked for just everything, you know, presents for the kids for their birthdays, you name it, we go out there right now we're asking for shoes. I mean we're asking for shoes so that before school starts, we can do a shoe drive for all of these kids, because sometimes their parents will they don't have the money or don't want to use their money to take their kids to have good shoes when they go to school. I mean, you know, it's tough. It's tough. I do remember I was an educator. And I do remember one or two times when I looked down and the kids were like, he has holes in his shoes. So I'd very quietly just the next day and I go buy a pair of shoes and bring them back to school and say, \"Oh look mijito somebody dropped him off.\" \"Oh for me?\" \"It's like yeah, for you.\" You know, so they had a new pair of shoes. And sometimes, you know, one or two times. I mean, when they got home, they didn't have the shoes the next day because the mother took it away. You know, so you'd have to do a back and so just leave the shoe here. We'll put your ugly shoes back on when you go home and bring it back tomorrow. So you know, you have to know how to finagle and they were so excited, you know, so? Yeah, I mean, giving is always the best thing you can do for anybody. "

And these are the mom and dad that said I will adopt them I will take I will take care of them. I mean, that's huge. That's huge. These kids get so excited. And I mean, they jump up and down. I have a mommy, I'm gonna have a new Mommy, you know, and they're like, awesome, you know? And for us for those days. I mean, we have the bell. And we're supposed to ring it yesterday, [RINGS BELL]  but we'll ring it soon I'm sure. It's coming. So those like when we ring the bell, oh, my God it's like, wow, some of the girls, I mean, they cry, because they worked on that case, for nine months, they worked on a case for two years, three years, and then to know that finally they're going to go to a home, permanent home, or someone's gonna love them.

And they might not be together anymore. But they still argue why because if the mother gets the them, she gets the moneys, you know, the the Medicaid, all the Medicaid, what sort of resources that they can get goes to that mom, and then she helps the kids, sometimes they don't help the kid, sometimes they sell it all. And then it takes care of themselves for their drugs or whatever else it might be. You know, there's just so many different scenarios with these children. And then the father, there's three fathers to one mother with five kids. I mean, these situations are tough, they're very tough.

Ours is a larger community, but it's still small. And there's we're still a very cliquish neighborhood. You know, we know all our neighbors, a lot of other places don't know, their neighbors.

And when I when I was five, we moved to a farmhouse near White House near to a farm near White House, which is southeast of Tyler. I liked growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we'd swing out why over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring. I'd like to fly kites and in the summer nights we'd catch fireflies but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a Livewire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life, and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods. Fried okra. hoppin john that's rice and black eyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. [Sneeze] After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about the city live and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says Daddy, that's crazy. I just die if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing. But I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we live in a city. I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land. Have a sense of place and take pride in being Texan. If they lose our ties to the land. The price of progress progress is too high. "
