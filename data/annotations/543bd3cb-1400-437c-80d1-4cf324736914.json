I'm not going to state that about um gays and lesbians, but the one that does bother me quite a bit, is it is becoming very, very standard now, for a young boy and young girl to start living together before they get married. That that does bother me. It bothers me because I think that that uh you are cheapening yourself. You are really um um in in a possible way of your spouse, your, your friend all of a sudden saying \"I'm not married, so I'm going someplace else.\" And generally speaking, this is my opinion, the one that gets hurt the most is the girl. And and so even when I was teaching Sunday school, I would tell them and tell them and tell them. And it seems rather strange that almost all of the kids that were in my Sunday school class today are living together. "

And um one day, I remember my grandfather chewing me out because I didn't really rinse the water container for the chickens. And he said, \"Well, how would you like to be drinking water, you know, in something like this\". And, and as I've been doing the chores, I've noticed that every time I go out to give them like fresh water, maybe even they already had water. But once you take them fresh water, they, they start drinking right, right away. "

It's a short made up story about a life in Texas that was created in the 1980s. And since then, linguistic samples of people's, no, excuse me, linguist researchers have recorded a few 100 Texans reading it. They only use this recordings as samples of people's standard way of speaking as they try to track how speech and text has varies and changes over time.

I lived growing up in the country. When my chores were done. I'd ride my horses, pine trees, or hide down the creek, hike down the creek to fish or swim. One time we tried to rope a limb on a cypress tree and would swing out wide over the uh, swimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. And in the spring, I'd fly kites and on the summer nights I'd catch fireflies, but we called them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with corn cobs or pine cones. And the winner would build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and popcorn. I mean pecans. I guess I was a live wire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a fire uh, Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life. And for a long time, I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite food, fried okra, hoping John... hoping or hoppin john, hoping I guess, John's rice and black eyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good times. But going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city, but my wife and kids don't understand me. When I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country, my oldest child says \"Daddy, it's crazy. I just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost cried. When my first time, she said for the first time, she said that. I know Texas is changing. But I tried to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots, when we may live in a city, while we may live in a city, I want my child and my kids to have a good feeling of the land, have a sense of place and have time for being Texans. I've, if they lose, if they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high."
