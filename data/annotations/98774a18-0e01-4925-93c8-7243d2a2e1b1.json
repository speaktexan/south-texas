I've lived in Texas all my life. I was born in Titus County. Do I say that? [INTERVIEWER\nNODS] Okay, let me start over. I've lived in Texas all my life. I was born in Titus County. And when I\nwas five, we moved to a farm near White House, which is southeast of Tyler. I liked growing up in the\ncountry. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees, or hike down to the creek to fish or\nswim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we'd swing out wide over the swimming\nhole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring, I'd fly Clyde\nkites, and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd\nhave fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter. We build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn\nand roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a Livewire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a\nFirestone Tire store. I didn't like save life. And for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama\nwould always cook my favorite foods fried Oka, Hot fried okra, okra hopping John. That's rice and black\neyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy\ndied, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in\nthe city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to\nthe country. My oldest child says, Daddy, that's crazy. I just die if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried\nthe first time she said that. I know Texas is changing. But I try to make sure we don't lose touch with\nour roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land. Have a sense\nof place and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress just too\nhigh"}]}],"tags":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Transcription, Participant"}],"uuid":"5529982c-05d0-4f70-bb3a-9368fcc40f56"},{"start_time":1946,"end_time":1951,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Well, thank you for adding your voice to the collection though.
