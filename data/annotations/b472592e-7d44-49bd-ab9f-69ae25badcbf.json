Growing up whenever we, there was dinner, breakfast or lunch served at my house, we all used to sit together at the table. And nowadays uh, like my kids, they want to go to the room, they want to get their food, go to their room, or eat later. And that's one of the things that I like insisted on. If I was picky on anything. I was like, we're gonna have dinner, we're all gonna have do it like as a family and put your phones away. I don't want you sitting at the table uh, with your phone in your hand. That was one thing I that got really strict on for some reason. Even my wife agreed, uh. It also allowed I think it allowed that that time to sit down with your family. You know, bonding, you get to talk to your kids find out what they're feeling what they're going through in school, instead of just sitting there because I've, I've gone to other family members houses and I see that everybody's sitting at a table but everybody's on their cell phones so like there's not much conversation going on.

I just have one last request for you before we conclude our interview. One of our overarching research questions throughout the Home to Texas program is about linguistic changes in Texas. As part of this project, a linguistics researcher is asking that interview participant read a brief passage, which should only take a couple of minutes. It's a short, made up story about life in Texas that was created in the 1980s, and since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few hundred Texans reading it. They use these recordings as samples of people's standard way of speaking as they try to track how speech and Texas varies and changes over time. Would you be willing to read a brief passage out loud?"

              "text": "\"I lived in Texas all my life. I was born in Titus County and when I was five, we moved to a farm near Whitehouse, which is just southeast of Tyler. I like growing up in the country. When my chores were downe, at I'd ride my horse, climb trees, or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree and we'd swing out, we'd  swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on the vine. In the spring, I'd fly kites, and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we call them like li-lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with our corn, fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was, I guess I was live wire. When I was 19, I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life, and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods fried okra, Hoppin' John-- that's rice and black-eyed peas--and pecan pie. We had a lot of good times, but going home is not the same. Now. After dad, after daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just died. I'd just died if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our, with our roots. While we may live in the city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land and have a sense of place and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high.\" "
