I liked growing up in the country. When my chores were\ndone, I'd ride my horse, climb trees and hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope\nvine to a cypress tree, and we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water [Truck\nin background]. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine [Laughter and truck in background]. Been\nthere done that. In the spring, I'd fly kites, and on summer nights we'd catch fl- fireflies - but we call him\nlightening bugs. Once in a while, we had flights- fights with corncobs or pine cones. In the winter, we'd\nbuild a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts poi- and pecons. I guess I was a\nLivewire. When I was 19, I moved to work in Dallas at Firestone Tire shore- store. I didn't like city life\nand for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always put my favorite foods: fried\nokra [Truck in background], hopping johns- that's rice with black eyed peas- and pecan pie. Not pecan,\nbut pecan. We had a lot of good times, but going home was not the same now. After daddy died, Mama\nsold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city, but\nmy wife and I- can kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the\nold country. My oldest child says, \"Daddy, that's crazy. I'd die if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost cried\nthe first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our\nroots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling in the- for the land, have a\nsense of place, and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is\ntoo high. Now is that for linguists this? You should have gotten my sister in law to read that."
