I think that that building is now used for administration for the school offices, administration for the school district. So it really went it just flourished, I think, which is good.

And I remember coming home and crying, you know. It was hard for my mother, how do you [DEEP SIGH]. But there was a lot of discrimination, even, even within ,the, my Catholic faith. There was [FIRST COMMUNITY CHURCH NAME] which, is, was in the south part of [COMMUNITY NAME], and in the north side was a [SECOND COMMUNITY CHURCH NAME].

And so they got all their their monies, to, to be able to take care of this, but and of course we had two nursing, I mean to medical schools. We had [TEXAS UNIVERSITY NAME] was had the residents training there, and [SECOND TEXAS UNIVERSITY NAME] had theirs. So this, this tool will actually would have we had three hospitals they were [DOOR OPENS IN BACKGROUND], they were taken care of by students from this two schools.

I think there is a small, I've never researched it, but I think there is a small resource available through the county, that they, um, pay the hospital for taking care of the indigent.

So now, um, my last request is the standardized reading passage module. So I'm just going to explain why we're doing this. So one of the overarching research questions through the Home to Texas program is about linguistic changes in Texas. As part of this project, a linguistic researchers asking the interview participants read a brief passage, which only take a couple of minutes. It is a short made up story about life in Texas that was created in the 1980s and since then, the linguistic researchers have recorded a few 100 Texans reading it. They use his recordings as samples of people's standard way of speaking as they try to track how speech in Texas varies and changes over time. "

              "text": "\"I've lived in Texas all my life. I was born in Titus County. And when I was five, we moved to a farm near White House, which is south east of Tyler. [CHUCKLES] I like growing up in [STUTTERS] in the country. When my [STUTTERS] chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied, we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I pretend to be Tarzan [CHUCKLES] swinging on a vine. In the spring, I fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while, we have fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter would build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was the live wire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas as a Firestone Tire store, at a Firestone tires store. I didn't like city life, and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Momma would always cook my favorite foods fried: okra, Hoppin' John, that's rice and black eyed peas, and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me. When I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the county, to the country. My oldest child says, \"Daddy, that's crazy. I just die if I had to live on a farm\" [CHUCKLES MIDSENTENCE]. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I tried to make sure we don't touch, loose touching with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for free land, for the land, have a sense of place and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high.\"  When I read, the first thing that jumped out at me when they're trying to say they [INAUDIBLE] moved to Tyler. Anybody that moved to Tay-Tyler that was Hispanic would have a big problem.[CHUCKLES]  Because Tyler was not only very much against Mexicans, it was also, in my time, it was also very much against Catholics. [CHUCKLES] When all my friends that started dating, when the well, she was my daughter's father in law- mother in law, she's passed away. And she told me a story about that when when she went her, intended well, they ended up getting married, but they were in high school. And so this this guy is calling her and her his best friend is saying,  \"Ask her ask her, ask her if she's a Catholic\". And so he said, \"Are you Catholic?\" And she because there was very few people in Tyler, Texas. And this was like probably in the more like in the 40, no, no, she was a tiny bit younger than me so it had to be the 50s. And she she said that, he asked her and she said \"Yes I'm [INAUDIBLE],\"  \"Hang up hang up, she's Catholic!\" [LAUGHS] And I thought, boy never have I, I've seen discrimination with race but never with religion, but Tyler, Texas is very. But uh, it is true farm life, if you grew up in the farm, and [COMMUNITY NAME] was almost, I have no idea how I had this in my mind. My mother and her sister, her only sister were very close. And when my grandparents moved to [COMMUNITY NAME], they bought a lot that was sort of rec-rectangular. And as we grew up [INAUDIBLE] I, when they grew up my mother and her sister. And, um, they ended up getting married here in [COMMUNITY NAME]. And they, they build their houses in that lot. One was facing the west side and the other one was facing the east side, and they shared a backyard. And in that backyard, man they had, after a while my uncle had opened a store and my daddy had, he built a little store there. And my father had built a little service station type of repair shop that's what it was. Yeah, auto repair shop. And I when I came back from college and I was, the, the place was up for sale, and I was, really wanted to buy it. I wanted to keep it. My son said \"Mom, you're crazy. You know, it's, it's it's a bad neighborhood,\" I said, but it wasn't bad when I was growing up! And then I went to look at it anyway. And I have no idea how small both our houses could have been because there's only room for one nice house that my uncle built because he ended up owning it. And a backyard and how do we had two businesses, two houses [LAUGHS]. But yeah, [LAUGHS] I wanted it, I wanted that property back, because it would remind me of my childhood. "
