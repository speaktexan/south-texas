What does that mean? That means that I'm in\ncharge of ensuring that the team work safe, that we provide exceptional customer service to our\ncommunity, the service that the services that we provide are essential services, right? It's essential for\na community you run and run efficiently and safely. Um Because if we don't, if we don't pick up our\ngarbage, right, that leads to health issues. So we're very conscious, cautious and conscious of that\nservice. And another thing is people are paying for that service. So we have to make sure that that\nservice is providing that service. So let me back up a little and tell you Public Works is comprised of\nfour funds, right for four separate government funds, the funding comes from different places. Um And\nthere's 14 departments within public works. But Public works is just the name of the operation. It's the\nthe name of the umbrella. But individually, we have 14 functional departments. And they're all funded\ndifferently. We've got 298 employees, so we have a big a big group. um And so we have the general\nfund is, is funded, we have streets, drainage, graffiti, sidewalk construction, and street sweeping, right.\nSo that service is we offset it by using taxpayer dollars for those five departments. And then we have\nsolid waste sanitation fund. So that's funded. We don't use any taxpayer dollars. To operate this, we\noperate it as a business, because it's called an enterprise fund and government. And so all it means is\nit runs like a business brings in revenue, and has expenses. Because we charge for the services.\nThat's the money that we use to buy every everything, pay for employees. Everything is in in that fund\noperates like a business um. The internal services fund is our fleet operations and materials\nmanagement, fleet operations, they repair all the fleet throughout the city have over 1000 pieces of\nequipment. And it's more like 1200 pieces of equipment. The only thing we do not maintain is the\nbuses, the the green Metro buses, those are the only ones because those are federally funded 100%.\nSo they require certain certifications for um for, for for the trucks to be worked on. And so it's it's the\nonly thing we don't repair with fire engines, fire trucks, motorcycles, everything in the city, loaders,\ndozers, every single piece of equipment that we operate, we repair it here. So what we do is we charge\nthe department for that service for repairing their vehicles, right. And that's how we sustain that as well\nas materials management is basically an inventory. department if we we buy and we buy in bulk. So it's\na cheaper. So it's a it's a it's more economical for the entire city if we buy in bulk. So the departments\ncome here and they buy the products from from us the only thing we don't carry is um office supplies\nwe did for a while but we hired an intern to help us find out what were our efficiencies and inefficiencies\nwere in our materials management and what was worth carrying in terms of inventory because\ninventory can be waste. We learned that through the through, you know the Six Sigma program. And so\nwe learned that office supplies was something that was not uh efficient for us to carry because all\nthese Office Depot and OfficeMax and all these stores, staples and all they have a delivery service and\nso it's easier and cheaper for them just to get it deliver when they need it and so that was the only thing\nthat we don't carry uh. What else the then we have the sanitation fund. The sanitation depreciation fund\nis for on sanitation all the garbage trucks and everything that we run through the sanitation fund, we\ncharge a um rental fee, if you will. It's is for every vehicle we purchase, we set aside 15% annually of the cost of that unit. So at the end of its depreciation cycle, we have the mney to buy it up front, we don't lease any of our equipment, we buy everything, cash, everything we buy in the millions. Because we've built it, it hasn't always been that way. Remember, when I first started here would not like that\nthe cost of that unit. So at the end of its depreciation cycle, we have the money to buy it up front, we don't lease a"}]}],"tags":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Participant"}],"uuid":"7eba198e-4da7-4e9f-b5f9-a6b620002035"},{"start_time":1233,"end_time":1368,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"It was not like that we would buy everything. um At auction used equipment, it was hard to operate um.\nBut because we've been running things lean and efficient, and we're frugal with our money and very\nfiscally responsible, we now have those funds to help us buy that, right because it became, it came to a\npoint where it was not safe for them, for us to buy used equipment. And not only was it sit not safe, but\nit was wasn't fiscally responsible, because we would buy them upfront, you know, 37,000, for example,\nfor a loader, but in a period of five to six years, you would spend over $100,000, maintaining it to keep\nyou going and at the end of the day, it's not really the right thing, right. But that's what we could afford\nat the time, once we build up the fund. We can, but you got to be looking at it. Because one thing can\ntip over the other. Right? The what we learned through COVID was the price hike was astronomically\ncrazy. So we went from saving 10% of the cost of the unit to 15 to be able to fund it because we were\nshort, in the hundreds of 1000s of dollars to buy a piece of equipment. So we went from buying a trash\ntruck that was costing us $180,000 a year to now we pay close to $400,000 a year, it's a big increase.\nSo we're having to take the hit for it um to be able to fund it at the time of depreciation. So anyway,\nthose you've got to be always looking, always always looking at not only your annual budget, but also\nlooking at your assets. We've got hundreds of millions of dollars and assets.
