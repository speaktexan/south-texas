Uh, but but it was, it didn't. I cannot say that it that it didn't shape me it definitely shaped me uh, considerably. You know, as far as who I am and how I am and things I do. I know some of the traits you're born with. But other traits you also develop, you know, as you go along. So it was it was a good thing. And and again, I'm forever grateful because it provided very well, for my family. We're not rich, [SHORT PAUSE] but we're far from poor, we never lacked, and it was a lot easier for me than it was for my my father to be a provider. Because there was there was plenty and there was more than enough and enough is plenty, you know, I didn't have to go strive like my dad did, you know? So [INAUDIBLE] it helped out quite a bit.  "

I don't find any discrepancies whatsoever. My roots are from Mexico. My history is from Mexico, this [REFERRING TO THE COMMUNITY]  was Mexico at one point, my family goes back many generations as you know, in this in, even in this area, when it was Mexico, so, uh, I don't see anything, uh, uh [SHORT PAUSE] that I think I think it's very important to keep in contact with your culture, uh. Culture is a big important factor in people's lives. Uh. The little things that give you, uh [SHORT PAUSE] cultural value, like say, Quinceañeras, bailes, music, entertainment, uh, [EMPHASIS] food, reasons to gather you know, and celebrations that we that we have in our culture. Uh,[SHORT PAUSE] I don't oppose sweet sixteens but I don't approve of them. I think quinceañeras are more cultural, we can identify with a quinceañera-we really can't identify with the sweet 16 It doesn't make any cultural sense to me. Uh, [SHORT PAUSE] foodwise- we have some of the most [EMPHASIS] delicious food on earth. You know, we cook with a spirit of[SHORT PAUSE] being [EMPHASIS] mexicano. It's very important to be mexicano and to be to relate to it. So most of our, our diet and our traditions are, are evident just by who we are. Uh. language wise, I believe we should say words that are in Spanish in Spanish, you know, and, and don't, uh, don't [SHORT PAUSE] change the value of the word because you pronounce it different. For for example, uh for a-good example. A little town like San Juan is [PRONOUNCES NAME WITH MEXICAN ACCENT] San Juan. It's not [PRONOUNCES NAME WITH AMERICAN ACCENT]San Juan. It's not San Juan. It's [PRONOUNCES NAME WITH MEXICAN ACCENT] San Juan. Okay. My last name is [PRONOUNCES LAST NAME WITH MEXICAN ACCENT]. It's not [PRONOUNCES LAST NAME WITH AMERICAN ACCENT]. Okay. [PRNOUNCES NAME WITH MEXICAN ACCENT] Sandoval is Sandoval not [PRONOUNCES NAME WITH AMERICAN ACCENT] Sandoval. [PRONOUNCES NAME WITH MEXICAN ACCENT] Davila is Davila not [PRONOUNCES NAME WITH AMERICAN ACCENT] Davila. Okay. It's, I think those kinds of traditions, we should [SHORT PAUSE] we should place more emphasis on and embrace them as as they are, as they were, as they should be. And that not sort of, uh, uh, for lack of a better term, Americanize them, uh like like anglicize them, we we have a tradition we have, we have a culture and I think the preservation of our culture is very important. "

Like I said, when I arrived here was about 30,000 people in [COMMUNITY NAME], and everybody knew everybody, you know, and now, it's roughly about 85,000 people. So that's 50,000 people more. And I think that census is incorrect. But that's a political thing. Uh. [SHORT PAUSE] It could never stay the same. Technology has to come in and has come in and pretty much has dominated,uh, the growth. Okay, uh. Very, very, uh. as we as we became more populated, the demands were more, um, necessary. Um. We were able to think, and memorize things much better back in the day. But now because of technology, we, have uh, everybody has a phone. Everybody has more than one TV, everybody has more than one vehicle. Everybody has, uh, uh, a a household income, a two household, two income household, the vast majority of us are like that. We're more career oriented, things like that. So so a lot of the b[SHORT PAUSE] a lot of the things that were not present in the 70s, like, uh traditional home values, per se, for and again, for lack of a better term, they're kind of they kind of dissipated along the way, where education was not something that was pushed by by my parents generation. Uh, I know that we were pushed to graduate from high school, which was like a major accomplishment. And it's now like a stepping stone. Uh, more, we're geared more towards educating at the university levels at the college levels. Uh. More than more than ever before, uh. which is a good thing, which is a good thing. But we also have to remember that that, uh there's nothing wrong with being a plumber, there's nothing wrong with being a mechanic. There's nothing wrong with being  a-working, produce or working. I mean, it's they all serve purposes. But it's also, uh, beneficial to be an engineer, to be a lawyer to be a doctor to be a, uh, an accountant. You know, of course, almost everything ties in, everything ties in, there's way more of that now than ever before than ever before. I remember, even,uh, at the at the time that we were in high school, in our little town of [COMMUNITY NAME] that 30,000 people to my knowledge, there was only a handful of beauty salons. You know, beauty salons, my sister [SISTER'S NAME] works as, as a beauty salon person, whatever they called- a cosmetologist, you know, and then all of a sudden they're a dime a dozen. They're everywhere. You know, like Yeah, it's good. It's good. Uh, but there's, I mean, you have to work really, really, really hard. Not that the other jobs don't require hard works it is very different work. You work there's more mind work than there is physical work, you know, but as far as the area's concerned we have all kinds of amenities now that were unheard of, uh or unthought of, you know, I was I was fortunate enough to to witness the change from black and white TV to color TV. From color TV to these giant screen TVs. I was fortunate enough to see the, uh  black and white pictures go to colored pictures to go to Polaroids to go to cameras on your phone that take much sharper images than than the cameras that we had back then. So very fortunate to see the telephone system is skyrocket, skyrocket cable TV versus UHS and VHS. We have FM radio here now, I still don't like it. Uh, But it's still it's, it's something that we never, I like as a kid, as a 13 year old teenager, FM radio was the thing. In [CITY IN ILLINOIS] we didn't listen to am radio, you know, when we came over here was all a ham radio, which is, uh a very different circuit. So, so it's it was the modulation was different. And so the sound was different. And it wasn't clear and it was, if you went under an overpass it would cut out because it was amplified. Okay, and now it's frequency modulated so so all of that is going into, took it to a different area. But even that has changed, because now it's satellite satellite has a lot to do with it. Or what we know now is Bluetooth, all that kind of stuff. Well not Bluetooth, but uh what do you call like Spotify?  "

And then I, I saw her one time speaking to a customer from Mexico with the most fluent Spanish I had ever seen an Anglo lady speak. And then after the conversation was over, she told me, \"and yes, I understood every single word you said about me.\" And I felt like oh, my God [PUTS HEAD IN HANDS] [CHUCKLES] But yeah, that was the worst experience I had with. "

I think music started to become more of a noise, uh, rock wise. In 1985 on or about. In fact, I stopped listening to rock music altogether, and listen more to progressive and alternative jazz. Uh. Because it was it was more musically inclined, they showed off their talents. And in the 1980s, I saw them- uh. You didn't have to have talent, you just have to have a good body. And you had to have the, the, the, the will, to show off your body. And that made you a good performer. It's like you had no musical skill, you can't sing. You can't play, you can't do anything. You know, but you can't even dance or you can do strip, you know. So- uh. that made you a good musician. Now with the 90s, where vulgar words, were starting to be more acceptable. Uh. The more you curse, the better performer you are. And that's simply not true. In my day, you have one or two songs that said a curse word. And they were automatically great songs. But I learned it from way back then. That no, it's not a good song. It's pretty much pretty lousy songs. You know, it's like, like you didn't really, you didn't have to say that. You know, one word, one song, in particular \"Hair of the Dog\" -horrible song, horrible song, but if you listen to the lyrics, it's over and over and over a curse word. So everybodys like, \"ah, that's a great song. That's a great song.\" No, it's not. It's a lousy song. You liked it because it said something that you weren't that you weren't supposed to say or hear. So like, was it more descriptive? Was it more liberal? Most definitely. But no. The 90s was pretty much a curse of music. "

One of the overarching research questions through the home in Texas program is about linguistic changes in Texas. As a part of this project, a linguistic researcher is asking that interview participants read a brief passage, we should only take a couple of minutes. It's a made up story about life in Texas that was created in the 80s and since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few 100 Texans reading it. They use these recordings as samples of people standard way of speaking as they try to track our speech in Texas varies and changes over time. Are you willing to read a brief passage out loud?  "

And when I was five, we moved to a farm near The White House, which was southeast of Tyler. I like growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees, or hike down [BREAK IN SPEECH] to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring, I'd fly kites, on the summer nights we'd watch fireflies but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while we had fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter, we'd build a fire in a fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess [QUICK PAUSE] I was a Livewire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life. And for a long time, I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook [BRIEF PAUSE] my favorite foods fried okra. hoppin john, that's rice and black eyed peas, and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is now not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me. When I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing. But I tried to make sure we don't lose touch with our our roots. While we may live in the in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land. Have a sense of place and take pride in being Texan. If they lose their ties to the land. The price of progress is too high. "
