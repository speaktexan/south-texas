I was born in Travis County. And when I was five, we moved to a farm near Whitehouse, which is southeast of Tyler. I like growing up in the country- in the country. When my chores were done. I ride my horses, climb trees, or hike down on the creek to fish or swim. One time we tie a rope to a limb of a cypess tree, and we'd swing out  wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I pretend to be Tarzan, swining on a vine. In the spring, I'd fly kites, and on summer nights, we'd catch fireflies-- but we called them lightning bugs. Once in a while, we'd have fights with corn cobs or pinecones. In the winter, we build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a livewire. When I was 19, I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone tire store. I didn't like city life, and for a long time I go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods: fried okra, Hoppin John- that's just rice and black eyed peas- and pecan pie. We had a lot of good times. But going home is not the same now. After Daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child said, \"Daddy, that's crazy. I just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing. But I try to make sure we don't lose touch with other roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land. Have a sense of place and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our tie in the land, the price of progress is too high. "}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Speaker","tag":"Participant"}],"uuid":"209007d6-469a-4ef6-b621-fb16d1a56337"},{"start_time":2377,"end_time":2392,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"All right, well, thank you for your wonderful contribution to this interview and these questions.
